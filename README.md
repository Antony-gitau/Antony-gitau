                                                    An engineer in the making

---
I am recently writing Python to:
  - develop pose estimation models using PyTorch.
  - develop [dash apps](https://dash.plotly.com/) to quickly show my models.
  - Using healthcare data such as ECG, webcam stream, sound, to train ML solutions.
      - I am handling webcam related data input with opencv
  - exploratory data analysis with seaborn, matplotlib, numpy and pandas.
  -  reproducing ML papers using TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, PyTorch such as object detections, vision transformer

I am also learning backend development:
  - using python Flask
  - using databases such as Influxdb

I am also coding documents:
 - using overleaf (pretty cool for technical reports, and scientific papers, and posters)

I am open to collaborations
- I can be contacted [here](https://antony-gitau.github.io/).
- I am also open to participate in challenges, competitions, ideations, and pitches with people with my skills or complementary ones.

Cheers!!
