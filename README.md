I am an early researcher at the intersection of medicine and engineering, driven by a lifelong passion for learning.

My career plan involves pursuing a postgraduate degree with a focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and an interest in using a wide range of health data, including biological, medical, and clinical data, to improve healthcare outcomes.

I am building skills in mathematics, statistics, programming, deep (machine) learning, biology, data stewardship & visualization, and scientific communication.
